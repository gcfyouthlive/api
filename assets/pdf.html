<!-- <p>As parents / legal guardian of participant <b>FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME</b>,</p>
<p>I understand and recognize that there may be inherent risks involved in the activities of <b>Camp LIVE: VERIFIED (High School Camp)</b> held under the auspices of Greenhills Christian Fellowship (GCF), from May 31-June 3, 2017, at Batangas Country Club, and I hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless GCF, its camp organizers, volunteers, employees, contractors or subcontractors (Organizers), including the officers or trustees of GCF, from any and all liability for injuries, including those that may result in death, and/or illnesses incurred while participating or attending in said Camp. I also give my expressed consent to the Organizers to transport said Participant to and from the Camp venue in church- owned or leased vehicles, and hold GCF and/or the Organizers free from any liability for any injury to or damage to the person of the Participant or to his/her belongings during travel.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the event that I am not immediately available, should the Participant suffer a serious or life-threatening injury for which emergency medical treatment may be necessary, I hereby authorize the Organizers to engage qualified medical personnel to initiate any necessary medical treatment or care, and that they will use all reasonable efforts to notify me, where practical, and I hereby give permission to any such physician or other medical personnel to provide such medical treatment as deemed medically appropriate.</p> -->
<p>We, the Camp Organizers and Staff of GCF Youth LIVE, strive to make <b>CAMPLIVE: VERIFIED</b> a memorable, meaningful, fun and safe experience for your child. While every reasonable precaution will be taken to prevent any untoward incidents during the Camp itself and in transit to and from the venue, we are unable to comprehensively foresee and prepare for every potential contingency that may cause injury to your child or damage to their belongings, as every activity inherently poses some degree of risk. If you understand and accept these risks and, nevertheless, allow your child to attend and participate in the Camp, by signing below you agree and consent to the following conditions:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>That you hold GCF Youth LIVE, the Camp Organizers and Staff, the Venue and its staff, and the subcontracted Transportation Company and its personnel free from any and all liability for injury to your child or damage to their belonging throughout the duration of the Camp.</li>
  <li>That you hereby authorize the Camp Organizers and Staff to decide and act on your behalf when you cannot be immediately and reasonably contacted in the event of an urgent medical emergency involving your child.</li>
</ul></p>
